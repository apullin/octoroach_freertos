Motor Control @ 1000 Hz
 - DSP lib calls
 - large memory model
 - uses space(dma) ram
 - Reads 0th order hold from ADC module
 - Sets PWM
 
Steering Control @ 300 Hz
 - Software only loop
 - DSP lib calls
 - large mem model
 - uses space(dma) ram
 - Reads 0th order hold from IMU module
  
 ADC DMA copy @ 5 Khz
 - hardware _DMA0Interrupt
 - uses space(dma) ram
 - Triggered automatically, DMA is only ISR
 
IMU @ 1 khz
 - makes I2C read -> hardware interrupt
 - makes SPI read -> hardware interrupt
 - zero order hold to provide values
 
I2C
 - TWO channels, both used.
 - no I2C interrupts
 - polls for Trans success
 - polls for ACK

SPI
 - hardware _DMA2Interrupt through _DMA5Interrupt
 - uses space(dma) RAM
 
Radio
 - Queues for RX/TX
 - hardware ISR state machine (RX, TX, transition)
 - Uses SPI bus + DMA
 
Gyro (subset of IMU)
 - I2C write/read
XL (subset of IMU)
 - I2C write/read
 
Telemetry @ 1 khz
 - Gets 0th order hold values from IMU
 - enqueues data to 
 
Flash
 - Could be queue driven?
 - Cannot tolerate full queue
 - Uses SPI + DMA
 
Commands
 - High level commands, come in over radio buffer
 - Command queue, gets processed, like APP layer
